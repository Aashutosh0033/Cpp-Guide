 *This repo contains all the important concepts of cpp which makes it powerful and unique.*<br><br><br>
 
 
 # C++
Cpp is a general purpose programming language which was developed as an enchancement to C langauge to include the Object-Oriented paradigm.It is an imperative and Compiled language. It is a middle-level language which renders it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels,etc) and high-level (Games, GUI, desktop apps) applications.

## Pointers

**What are Pointers:**
Pointers are basically variables used to store the address or the memory location of other varibles.<br><br>


![How-Pointer-Works-In-C](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83531337/161263377-ea9d9220-8856-4352-820a-9cfe051efcba.png)

Syntax to declare pointers: <br>
   data_type* ptr_name; <br>
    <br>
   For Ex: int a = 10; <br>
           int* ptr = &a; <br>
   
  <br>
  
  In the above example variable a stores value 10 in it. And after that a pointer is created and assigned it to the address of variable a. <br> <br>
  
  * To access the address of a variable, we use the unary operator &(ampersand) that returns the address of the variable. 
  * One more operator is *(asterisk) which is used for two things - (i) To declare a pointer (ii) To access the value stored inside the pointer(That is also called Dereferencing). 

 <br> <br>
 
 
 **Null Pointers:**
 
 Poiters can be assigned Null value when declared. It is a good practice to assign null value to pointers in case you do not have exact address to assign. <br> For Ex: int* ptr = NULL ;
 
  <br> <br>
  
  **Pointer Arithmetics:**
  
  As Pointers are numeric values, it is obvious that we can perform Arithmetic Operations on it. There are few useful Arithmetic Operations which can be performed on pointers <br>
* Increment(++)
* Decrement(--)
* An integer can be added to a pointer
* An integer can be subtracted from a pointer

Pointer Arithmetic is meaningless unless performed on an Array<br>
Pointer contains addresses. Adding two addresses makes no sense, because we may not know what it is pointing to. But subtracting two contiguos addresses may give us an offset which can be added to any address to get the next address.<br>

<br>

**Pointers vs Arrays:**

There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays. Pointers and Arrays are interchangeable in many cases. For ex a pointer that points to start of an array can access the elements either by Array-style indexing or by pointer arithmetics.<br>
Note: An Array name is also the pointer to itself.<br>
For ex: int arr[3] = {1,2,3};<br>
        cout<<arr;<br>
        //output<br>
        address of first elements memory location 

<br><br>


**Array of Pointers:**

You can use an Array to store collection pointers to int,char or any data type.<br>

<br>

**Pointer to Pointer:**

You can assign pointer to pointer. That means creating a pointer to store the value of other pointer.<br>
The syntax for pointer to pointer is as follows: <br>
int a = 10;<br>
int* ptr1 = &a;<br>
int** ptr2 = &ptr1;<br>


<br>

**Passing Pointer to functions:**

Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed arguments to be changed in the calling functions by the called functions.<br>
For Ex. Passing pointers to functions<br>
int main(){<br>
int a = 1;<br>
int b = 2;<br>
swap(&a,&b);<br>
This will change the value of the variables inside the calling functions

<br><br>
 
 
 
**Return Pointer from functions:**

A function can return pointers to local variable,static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well.<br>
To do so, you have to declare a function returning a pointer.<br>
For Ex. int* my_function(){}<br>

<br>


## References 

**What are References:**
A referene name is an alias, or another name for an already existing variable. Once a reference is initialised with a variable, either the reference name or the variable name can be used to refer the variable.<br>

Syntax for reference:<br>
int a = 10;<br>
int &b = a;<br>
cout<<a;<br>
cout<<b;<br>
//output: <br>
10<br>
10<br>

<br>

**References as Parameters:**
Reference variables can used as function parameters. It is a more safer way to call functions. This is also known as call by reference.<br>
For Ex.<br>
int a = 1;<br>
int b = 2;<br>
swap(a,b);<br>
<br>
int swap(int& c, int& d){}<br>

<br>

**Reference as Return Value:**

You can return reference from functions as any other data type. When a function returns a reference, it infact returns an implicit pointer to its return value.This way a function can be used on the left side of an assignment statement.<br>
Syntax: return_type& func_name(){};<br>

<br>

**Pointers vs References:**

References are often confused with pointers but three major differences between references and pointers are âˆ’<br>
* You cannot have NULL references. You must always be able to assume that a reference is connected to a legitimate piece of storage.<br>
* Once a reference is initialized to an object, it cannot be changed to refer to another object. Pointers can be pointed to another object at any time.<br>
* A reference must be initialized when it is created. Pointers can be initialized at any time.<br>
